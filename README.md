Since the native Tasmota integration only supports standard entities to HA ([switches, selects, numbers, etc.](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Home-Assistant/#supported-ies)), I opened a [discussion](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/discussions/19811) on Tasmota's repo with NeoPool dev, and decided for now to integrate all possible entities using purely HA's MQTT integration entities.

All NeoPool entities are created by the provided package `ha_neopool_mqtt_package.yaml` via the native MQTT entities of HA (Note: It does not created a new device, it creates entities only).

This integration needs at minimum [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/) v13.3.0 with compiled [NeoPool driver](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/NeoPool/).  
Since the NeoPool driver is not contained in Tasmota precompiled binaries, you need to compile your own build or use one of the precompiled binary from the [firmware](https://github.com/alexdelprete/HA-NeoPool-MQTT/tree/main/firmware) folder. If you initial flash your ESP with one of the precompiled binaries, you can skip the points "_Custom pre-configured Tasmota build_" and "_Configuration steps 1._" below.

For flashing ESP32/ESP8266 I highly recommend using [ESP_Flasher](https://github.com/Jason2866/ESP_Flasher) by @Jason2866, in v2.0.1 he kindly implemented by [my request](https://github.com/Jason2866/ESP_Flasher/issues/29) support for ESP32 high-speed baud rates (1.5Mb/s) for very quick and reliable flashing and he also added support for factory images.

## Custom pre-configured Tasmota build

NOTE for beginners: If you have no idea about how to custom compile Tasmota, you can use the precompiled files in the [firmware](https://github.com/alexdelprete/HA-NeoPool-MQTT/tree/main/firmware) folder.

When you custom compile your version, make sure to choose the dev branch and verify after flashing that version is at least `v13.2.0.2`. I will update notes to specify the stable min. version once known. When you custom compile your build, you'll need to use the `user_config_override.h` provided in the `compiler` folder of this repository; this will automatically enable NeoPool and also configure all settings automatically without requiring to manually follow the manual steps of next section.

The only thing you'll have to check is if the activated template is correct, you do this from Tasmota console executing command `Module`:

```console
13:41:13.489 CMD: Module
13:41:13.491 RSL: RESULT = {"Module":{"0":"NeoPool Atom Lite + Tail485"}}
```

If the result is not the one you see above, you need to issue the command `Module 0` to activate the preconfigured template:

```console
13:43:35.087 CMD: module 0
13:43:35.090 RSL: RESULT = {"Module":{"0":"NeoPool Atom Lite + Tail485"}}
```

In case you don't use the provided `user_config_override.h` file, you'll need to follow the Manual Configuration Steps section below.

## Wiring
Devices supported by Tasmota NeoPool have an RS485 modbus2 port where the ESP device is plugged in.

This ports looks like this one (pic taken from a Hayward device) and thats how pins match:

## Configuration steps

1. **Tasmota**  
   From Tasmota console, run these commands to optimize the device configuration:

    _This sets Retain flag for telemetry topic so that HA entities are immediately available_

    ```console
    SensorRetain 1
    ```

    _This ensures that Tasmota %topic% is set to `SmartPool` so you don't have to change all the topics in the package file_
    _It also sets device name, friendly name and mqtt client name (for easier identification in the broker)_

    ```console
    Backlog Topic SmartPool; DeviceName SmartPool; FriendlyName SmartPool; MqttClient SmartPool;
    ```

    _Define a rule to keep the Sugar Valley device clock in sync with Tasmota's device clock and also sets NeoPool SENSOR topic to update every 60s for often changed (measurements) values_
    _This also disables the device from being discovered by HA so it won't create unnecessary and duplicate entities for NeoPool_

    ```console
    Rule1 ON Time#Initialized DO NPTime 0 ENDON ON Time#Set DO NPTime 0 ENDON ON System#Boot DO Backlog Discover 0; NPTeleperiod 60; ENDON
    ```

    _Configure user template for GPIO definition based on device type_
    Atom Lite + Tail485 (GPIO26: NeoPool TX / GPIO32: NeoPool RX)

    ```console
    Template {"NAME":"NeoPool Atom Lite + Tail485","GPIO":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,6976,0,0,0,0,0,7008,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":1}
    ```

    Atom Lite + Atomic RS485 Base (GPIO19: NeoPool TX / GPIO22: NeoPool RX)

    ```console
    Template {"NAME":"NeoPool Atom Lite + Atomic RS485 Base","GPIO":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6976,0,0,7008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":1}
    ```

    AtomS3 Lite + Atomic RS485 Base (GPIO19: NeoPool TX - GPIO22: NeoPool RX)

    ```console
    Template {"NAME":"NeoPool AtomS3 Lite + Atomic RS485 Base","GPIO":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6976,0,0,7008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":1}
    ```

    Other ESP32/ESP8266 devices (GPIO3: NeoPool TX - GPIO1: NeoPool RX):

    ```console
    Template {"NAME":"NeoPool ESP32/ESP8266","GPIO":[1,6528,1,6496,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18}
    ```

    _Activate Rule1 and User GPIO Template_

    ```console
    Backlog Rule1 4;Rule1 1; Module 0;
    ```

2. **Home Assistant**  
   Add the [Home Assistant MQTT integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/) properly configured and working.
3. **Tasmota**

    Configure MQTT broker in your Tasmota SmartPool.

    1. Access the web interface by pointing your browser to its IP. You can find it out in your router or by discovering.

    2. Click in the `Configuration` menu option:
        ![alt text](image-2.png)
    
    3. Click in the `Configure MQTT` option:
        ![alt text](image-3.png)
    
    4. Fill in required data. Mandatory field is `Host`, but having `user` and `password` protection is a **great** idea.
        ![alt text](image-4.png)
    
      If you are using the Mosquitto addon in HAOS, the IP is the same of your HA server and you can create a new user directly in HA going to `Settings > People > User's tab > + Add new user`. It is recommended to **remove the "Admin" access** and make it **local access only**.
4. **Home Assistant**  
   Add `ha_neopool_mqtt_package.yaml` as [Home Assistant package](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/). Check [HA docs]((https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/)) on how to configure HA for package usage.

   Simpler way is to use the Studio Code Server o Terminal addons in HA and follow these steps:
   
   1. Create a directory called `packages` inside your `config` directory.
   2. Paste `ha_neopool_mqtt_package.yaml` file or create a new one with that same name and paste contents inside. You would endup having this:

      ![alt text](image.png)

   3. Edit your `configuration.yaml` file and add the package adding this line in the `homeassistant`:
      ```
      packages: !include_dir_named packages
      ```

      you'll end up having something like this:

      ![alt text](image-1.png)
    
    4. Restart HA (recommended) or go to developer options and make a full reload.

   This integration will not create a device, only entities. To check if the `ha_neopool_mqtt_package.yaml` is working, go to HA "Settings", "Devices & services", "Entities" and search for the entities "neopool_mqtt".
5. **Home Assistant**  
   Add the [HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)](https://hacs.xyz/), if not already done.
6. **Home Assistant**  
   The user interface uses the following cards, which are available via HACS and which you must first install:
   - [layout-card](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-layout-card)
   - [mini-graph-card](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card)
   - [custom-brand-icons](https://github.com/elax46/custom-brand-icons)
   - [mushroom](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom) (for the pc/notebook layout only)
   - [stack-in-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/stack-in-card) (for the pc/notebook layout only)
   - [text-divider-row](https://github.com/iantrich/text-divider-row) (for the pc/notebook layout only)
7. **Home Assistant**  
   Add one of the two provided lovelace UI `ha_neopool_mqtt_lovelace*.yaml`.  
   The lovelace UI yaml files here are extracted from the raw lovelace file. To use it edit the raw lovelace config within your HA Dashboard and paste the contents of one of the yaml file below the top word `views:`. Select one of the two possible lovelace files:
    - `ha_neopool_mqtt_lovelace.yaml` for pc/notebook display resolutions
    - `ha_neopool_mqtt_lovelace_responsive.yaml` using standard HA cards without resolution limitations
